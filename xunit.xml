<testcase classname="working with plugins" name="files upload" time="0"><failure>Cypress detected a cross origin error happened on page load:

  &#x3E; Blocked a frame with origin &#x22;https://cgi-lib.berkeley.edu&#x22; from accessing a cross-origin frame.

Before the page load, you were bound to the origin policy:

  &#x3E; https://berkeley.edu

A cross origin error happens when your application navigates to a new URL which does not match the origin policy above.

A new URL does not match the origin policy if the &#x27;protocol&#x27;, &#x27;port&#x27; (if specified), and/or &#x27;host&#x27; (unless of the same superdomain) are different.

Cypress does not allow you to navigate to a different origin URL within a single test.

You may need to restructure some of your test code to avoid this problem.

Alternatively you can also disable Chrome Web Security in Chromium-based browsers which will turn off this restriction by setting { chromeWebSecurity: false } in &#x60;cypress.json&#x60;.
